"0","#obnoxiously, normal bar charts go bottom to top, while facets go top to bottom.  Factoring the ""name"" variable the right way for the bar chart above messes up the facets below, and I'm not seeing an easy way to reverse the order of the facets to make it match the bar chart.  Will ignore for now, since it's not a crucial plot."
